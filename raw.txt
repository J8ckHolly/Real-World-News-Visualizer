Officials are urging migrants to use the newly repurposed CBP Home smartphone app to register for self-deportation.\n\nBut DHS said it retains the authority to target migrants who arrived under this program before the 30-day period lapses. Officials say those prioritized for arrest will include migrants who have failed to apply for another immigration benefit like asylum or a green card.\n\nIn a statement, DHS spokeswoman Tricia McLaughlin said the migrants allowed into the U.S. under the CHNV process were "loosely vetted," and argued the program undercut American workers.\n\n"The termination of the CHNV parole programs, and the termination of parole for those who exploited it, is a return to common-sense policies, a return to public safety, and a return to America First," McLaughlin added.\n\nIn:\n - [Venezuela](https://www.cbsnews.com/tag/venezuela/)\n- [Cuba](https://www.cbsnews.com/tag/cuba/)\n- [Deportation](https://www.cbsnews.com/tag/deportation/)\n- [Trump Administration](https://www.cbsnews.com/tag/trump-administration/)\n- [Migrants](https://www.cbsnews.com/tag/migrants/)\n\n[Camilo Montoya-Galvez](https://www.cbsnews.com/team/camilo-montoya-galvez/)\n\n[![camilo-montoya-galvez-bio-2.jpg ](https://assets1.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2024/05/17/f1a49163-df19-4118-a848-129c0ea14af9/thumbnail/160x160/6c1ee5306559875256b378388875f22a/camilo-montoya-galvez-bio-2.jpg?v=9e5c48f1b04ac2a564e8a4c51250ac89)](https://www.cbsnews.com/team/camilo-montoya-galvez/)\n\nCamilo Montoya-Galvez is the immigration reporter at CBS News.
